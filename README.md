Hello Team 2 this is where you're going to be for this whole semester so let get started:

This is the reposistory it is where versions of our game will be stored, so we can all add and change our game

B1 Art and Repository Change: You can't make a game with out a concept so this section is all about art and setting up our repository

---[GOALS]---

1. We should mock up our project at this stage there's no bad ideas, but we should curate to make an experiences that is managable and plausible within the time frame
2. We should have an overall idea of how GitHub works and that means using the Desktop Client or Online Version
3. And we should at least add one idea to the whole everyday if we can so we can sumbit it when it's due

REMEMBER THE GOAL IS TO HAVE FUN AND IF YOUR NOT HAVING FUN THEN ITS NO FUN FOR ANYONE
